      <title>Deep Inertial Prediction Challenge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Deep Inertial Prediction (DIPr) challenge&lt;/strong&gt; is a competition focused on improving short lasting IMU fallback tracking for VR systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIPr (&amp;ldquo;dipper”)&lt;/strong&gt; is a novel method for short-term IMU-only tracking for VR headsets that leverages deep learning which is intended to be used for fallback tracking for visual-inertial odometry or SLAM. To get started with the challenge you can visit the challenge &lt;a href=&#34;https://dipr.ai&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dipr.ai&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dipr.ai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/arcturus-industries/dipr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;instructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dipr.ai/sign-up&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sign up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Arcturus Industries. Here on our blog, we will share more on our team, our tech, what we are currently building, and opportunities to join us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arcturus Industries is raising the bar for realtime 3D perception. We deliver an unparalleled experience for VR and AR headsets, where every millisecond and every millimeter matter. We&amp;rsquo;re empowering headsets with state-of-the-art computer vision and robotics algorithms. We stand on the shoulders of giants and leverage the latest research ideas, but we also leave academic systems in the dust with our system&amp;rsquo;s precision, robustness, and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why using SLAM for Virtual Reality?</title>
      <link>https://arcturus.industries/blog-drafts/slam/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment that the user perceives through a device known as a headset and where the user can interact with the virtual environment using controllers. This visual, auditory and haptic setup makes the user feel immersed in a virtual world, and is being used in many applications, the main ones being gaming, culture, education and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the VR market is booming and is demanding for systems that are more affordable for users, require little or no setup and minimise the side effects of VR such as motion sickness, which consists of a dizziness induced by the mismatch between the real and virtual motions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for passionate, self-driven and talented engineers to improve 3D awareness in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to the next level. If building a robust, light-weighted and real-time deep learning system for AR/VR applications sounds like the right challenge for you, then please read on !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re a small and dedicated team developing state-of-the-art computer vision software. Before founding Arcturus Industries, our team built first-of-a-kind products in real-time spatial computing. Now based in Madrid and Seattle, we are pushing the boundaries of computer vision for mixed reality. Our first launch brought 3D perception &lt;a href=&#34;https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/2471861771402099478&#34;&gt;to SteamVR users&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

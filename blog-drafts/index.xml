      <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment that the user perceives through a device known as a headset and where the user can interact with the virtual environment using controllers. This visual, auditory and haptic setup makes the user feel immersed in a virtual world, and is being used in many applications, the main ones being gaming, culture, education and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the VR market is booming and is demanding for systems that are more affordable for users, require little or no setup and minimise the side effects of VR such as motion sickness, which consists of a dizziness induced by the mismatch between the real and virtual motions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

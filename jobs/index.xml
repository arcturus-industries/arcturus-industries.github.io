      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for passionate, self-driven and talented engineers to improve 3D awareness in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to the next level. If building a robust, light-weighted and real-time deep learning system for AR/VR applications sounds like the right challenge for you, then please read on !&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re a small and dedicated team developing state-of-the-art computer vision software. Before founding Arcturus Industries, our team built first-of-a-kind products in real-time spatial computing. Now based in Madrid and Seattle, we are pushing the boundaries of computer vision for mixed reality. Our first launch brought 3D perception &lt;a href=&#34;https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/2471861771402099478&#34;&gt;to SteamVR users&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
